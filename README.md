# Font Awesome Alternatives

Font Awesome doesn't display a few icons for whatever reason (it's not adblock or the browser), so I just decided to make svg and png versions as replacements for them. It's a hacky solution, I admit, but it should be a temporary one if you're unwilling or unable to edit the css, like me.

There are also some square alternatives for icons already in Font Awesome, as well additional icons that aren't presently there.

Credit to these is Joaquim Baeta, but no real need for attribution, just use or adapt them as you wish.
